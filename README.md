# filerecon - Advanced File Fingerprinting

The filerecon project is doing some research in the field of file fingerprinting. The goal is the highly accurate identification of given file structures. This is very important to identify file association (e.g. during a forensic analysis or data recovery).

Besides the discussion of different approaches and the documentation of gathered results also an implementation for automated analysis is provided. This software, which is inspired by the Unix tool file(1), shall improve the easyness and efficiency of this kind of enumeration.
